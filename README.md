DEPRECATED: Initial repo for a website that assists students of VNR VJIET engineering college on their daily activities and interactions within the campus

This project is made as a part of internhsip organized by our college VNR VJIET, bachupally, Hyderabad, Telangana.
My team consists of 4 members excluding me, whose names have been mentioned as contributors in my repository. We had chosen 'Web development' as our project domain.
We came up with the idea of creating a website for our college which is not an official website launched by the management, but is a website created by students, for the students,
solely to assist them in their day-to-day activities in the campus and also to guide those who arent familiar with what activity is going on in every corner of the campus,
hence the name, College guide.

our project is a simple website with lots of front-end and only a single database application on the backend.
  web technologies used for the following project are:
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. Jscript
  4. Node JS
  5. Mongo DB
  6. Express JS
  
  This website has user authentication where an exisiting user can Login and a new user can signup
  after authentication the user is directed to the home page where he can access various pages:
  1. SAC page: contains details and activities of all the clubs and their works and also about the annual fests since SAC houses all of these activities together under one roof
  2. Most visited : contains information about the various popular hotspots of the college where students visit frequently. this page provides existing information, tips, FAQs 
                    about these places that are initially unknown by many students.
  3. Sports page : contains information about VNR's very own sports complex which houses all the popular indoor and outdoor sports played by the students. This page also guides
                   user on how to apply to various sports, contact the sports staff and various other useful features.
  4. Guides : this is the main essence of the website as this is what which helps students on getting to know more about every room in the college they are unaware about.
    
    
  what are 'Guides' and how do they work?
  
  Guides are basically posts that are filled by few students about the rooms or the places they are well familiar with in the college, and these posts are viewed by all other 
  students who can view them in the index page.
  Guides page has three features:
  1. New : create a new guide
  2. Edit : edit the guide that was written by you
  3. Index : place where you can find all the guides written by various others
  
  Guides page is a form on the front end to fill and view and is connected to Mongo db database on the backend.
  
  all the pages in the website are connected by routes.
  
  HOPE YOU LIKED OUR PROJECT !!!!!
  
  Have a good day ;)
